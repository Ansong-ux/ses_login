## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL 12+
- npm or pnpm

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd COMPUTERENG
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-environment.js
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file with default configuration. Update `DATABASE_URL` with your database credentials.

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run database scripts in order:
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f scripts/01-create-database.sql
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f scripts/02-create-tables.sql
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f scripts/03-insert-sample-data.sql
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f scripts/10-create-fee-structure.sql
   
   # Generate password hashes for demo users
   node scripts/05-setup-demo-users.js
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at `http://localhost:3001`

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Errors

### Database Connection Issues

**Error**: `DATABASE_URL is not defined`
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `.env` file exists with valid `DATABASE_URL`
- Format: `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ce_department_db`
- Run `node scripts/setup-environment.js` to create `.env`

**Error**: `Connection refused` or `ECONNREFUSED`
**Solution**:
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials in `DATABASE_URL`
- Ensure database `ce_department_db` exists

### Authentication Issues

**Error**: `Invalid credentials`
**Solution**:
1. Run database setup scripts in correct order
2. Execute `node scripts/05-setup-demo-users.js` to hash passwords
3. Verify user exists in database

**Error**: `JWT_SECRET is not defined`
**Solution**:
- Add `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key` to `.env` file
- Run setup script to generate secrets

### TypeScript/Compilation Errors

**Error**: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution**:
- Project is configured to ignore build errors during development
- For production, fix type issues or remove `ignoreBuildErrors` from `next.config.mjs`
- Run `npm run build` to see all type errors

**Error**: Module resolution errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check `tsconfig.json` paths configuration
- Verify import statements use correct paths

### PowerShell Execution Policy Issues

**Error**: `Execution policy` restrictions
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
# Or use cmd instead:
cmd /c "npm run dev"
```

### Port Already in Use

**Error**: `Port 3001 is already in use`
**Solution**:
- Kill process using port 3001: `npx kill-port 3001`
- Or change port in `package.json`: `"dev": "next dev --port 3002"`

### Missing Dependencies

**Error**: `Cannot find module`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Database Schema Issues

**Error**: `relation does not exist`
**Solution**:
- Run all SQL scripts in correct order
- Check database connection and permissions
- Verify table names match exactly
